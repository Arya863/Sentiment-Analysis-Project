### Project Overview:-
This project involves analyzing textual data to determine sentiments, specifically focusing on user reviews. The primary goal is to preprocess the data and apply Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to classify sentiments effectively.
### Key Features:-
  - Data Preprocessing: Removal of stopwords,Lowercasing text,Tokenization,Stemming and lemmatization.

### Dataset:-
The dataset includes user reviews and corresponding ratings, which serve as the basis for sentiment classification.
### Tools and Libraries:-
  - Python: The primary programming language used.
  - Libraries:pandas for data manipulation,nltk for natural language processing,matplotlib for data visualization.
  
### Results:-
Sentiments are categorized as "Good," "Bad," or "Average" based on ratings,Bar graphs illustratethe distribution of sentiments across reviews.
### How to Run:-
  - Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-username/Sentiment-Analysis-Project.git
